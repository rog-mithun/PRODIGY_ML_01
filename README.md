# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model with feature engineering and regularization.

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or execute the Python script (`house_price_prediction.py`).

## File Descriptions
- `train.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset.
- `submission.csv`: Predicted house prices for the test set.

## Model Details
- Linear Regression with Ridge regularization.
- Polynomial features of degree 2.

## Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the training set.
- Cross-validation Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters.
